# 🧩 LEVEL 1 — First Word

Every journey begins with a single word.

Before you can move forward,  
you must **create a greeting**  
and **seal it with the word that begins everything**.

---

## 🔐 Rules of the Path

- The greeting must live in a file named **hello.txt**
- The seal must be placed when you commit
- The seal is a **single word**
- And that single word is synonym of **start** 
- No other name will open the gate
